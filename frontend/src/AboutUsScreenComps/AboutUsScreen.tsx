                <div className="meta">3rd Year · Business Management Economics · San Francisco</div>
                <p><span className="label">Academic interests/hobbies:</span> While I am obviously interested in economics, the reason I chose this major is because I'm fascinated by the consumer decision-making process. Learning about luxury brands, consumer game theory, decoy offerings and more is what keeps me interested in my academic career. Outside of academics I have a deep interest in consumer electronics both old and new. I collect retro video game consoles, build computers and buy used camera equipment to keep myself entertained. I also more recently have been getting involved with some automotive projects and am looking forward to learning more about cars.</p>

                <p><span className="label">Academic interests/hobbies:</span> I am interested and have experience in many different software and hardware topics such as RTL design, embedded design, and computer architecture. Most of my experience comes from school projects and other events such as CruzHacks. Outside of school I enjoy playing and watching sports such as soccer and volleyball and like going to the beach. This next year I will be working towards getting my Masters in Computer Engineering from UC Santa Cruz.</p>

                <div className="meta">6th year · Robotics/Computer Engineering(Digital Hardware) · Torrance, LA County</div>
                <p><span className="label">Academic interests/hobbies:</span> My primary interests lie in embedded systems design, focusing on bridging the gap between hardware and sensor integration to develop practical, impactful technologies. As a transfer student, my journey has been longer than most, but it has allowed me to delve deeper into the world of engineering systems and gain a wide range of valuable experiences along the way. Outside the classroom, I enjoy exploring the outdoors through backpacking and hiking—something Santa Cruz offers right outside the classroom. I'm also passionate about basketball and running. Having completed several marathons and longer, I embrace the challenge of pushing my limits, both academically and physically.</p>
